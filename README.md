##Datagram

Each datagram generated by client.c must contain

* a sequence number which identifies the packet, 
* a timestamp with microsecond level precision which indicates the time at which the packet is first transmitted,
* an even non-negative integer called the time-to-live field (TTL) with initial value T


##Client-Echo Interaction

When echo.c receives a datagram from client.c, it immediately decrements the TTL value in the datagram and sends the same datagram (with the new TTL) back to
client.c. The client.c program on receiving a datagram from echo.c, decrements the TTL value, and checks if this new value is zero. If the new TTL is greater than zero,
then client.c sends the datagram (with the new TTL) back to echo.c.
